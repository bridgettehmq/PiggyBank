## Technologies Used:


## Setup

1. Run `npm i`.
2. You will need an existing MySQL database.
3. Create `.env` file with MySQL credentials for local development and a SECRET. Refer to [.env.EXAMPLE](./.env.EXAMPLE)
4. Run `npm start` to start the app.


## Sessions

[express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) and [connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) are used for session management. Configure cookies and sessions in [config/session.js](./config/session.js)

## Authentication

Passwords are hashed using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt). Middleware for protected routes redirects to `/login`. This can be modified by updating [util/withAuth.js](./util/withAuth.js).

## Templates

[Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) are used for rendering templates.

You can add your own custom helper functions by exporting them from [util/helpers.js](./util/helpers.js).

## Code Style

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are included for enforcing consistent code quality and format. The default configuration includes the ESLint recommended plugin, the Prettier plugin, plus a couple of additional rules. Modify [.eslintrc.js](./.eslintrc.json) to customize the rules.

## Potential features for future development 

- Additional Drink Search Parameters
    - Having a choice for Alcoholic vs. Non-Alcoholic would allow for a wider user audience and more inclusive experience.
- Random Ingredient Suggestion
    - If the user does not have an ingredient in mind, having a randomizer would allow our application to be more flexible.
- Better Food-Favorites Functionality
    - Preventing the user from adding a recipe to the favorites twice.
- Recipe Photos 
    - Adding recipe photos would be more enticing and exciting for the user!
- CSS Layout 
    - Development on fonts, backgroud colors, buttons, etc to better user's visual experience.
